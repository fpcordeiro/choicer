mnl_loglik_numeric_hessian(
  theta,
  X,
  alt_idx,
  choice_idx,
  M,
  weights,
  use_asc = TRUE,
  include_outside_option = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{K + J - 1 or K + J vector with model parameters}

\item{X}{sum(M) x K design matrix with covariates. Stacks M[i] x K matrices for individual i.}

\item{alt_idx}{sum(M) x 1 vector with indices of alternatives within each choice set; 1-based indexing}

\item{choice_idx}{N x 1 vector with indices of chosen alternatives; 1-based indexing relative to X; 0 is used if include_outside_option=True}

\item{M}{N x 1 vector with number of alternatives for each individual}

\item{weights}{N x 1 vector with weights for each observation}

\item{use_asc}{whether to use alternative-specific constants}

\item{include_outside_option}{whether to include outside option normalized to 0 (if so, the outside option is not included in the data)}

\item{eps}{finite difference step size}
}
\value{
Hessian evaluated at input arguments
