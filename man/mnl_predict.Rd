\usage{
mnl_predict(
  theta,
  X,
  alt_idx,
  M,
  use_asc = TRUE,
  include_outside_option = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{K + J - 1 or K + J vector with model parameters}

\item{X}{sum(M) x K design matrix with covariates. Stacks M[i] x K matrices for individual i.}

\item{alt_idx}{sum(M) x 1 vector with indices of alternatives within each choice set; 1-based indexing}

\item{M}{N x 1 vector with number of alternatives for each individual}

\item{use_asc}{whether to use alternative-specific constants}

\item{include_outside_option}{whether to include outside option normalized to 0 (if so, the outside option is not included in the data)}
}
\value{
List with choice probability and utility for each choice situation evaluated at input arguments
}
