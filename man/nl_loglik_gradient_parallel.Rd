1-based index relative to rows in X_i otherwise.}

\item{M}{N x 1 vector with number of alternatives for each individual.}

\description{
Computes the log-likelihood and its gradient for the Nested Logit model using OpenMP for parallelization.
Especially handles singleton nests by fixing their lambda parameters to 1. Only non-singleton nests have a inclusive value coefficient estimated in theta.
