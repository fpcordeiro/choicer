\title{choicer: A package for discrete choice models.}
\description{
Tools for estimating discrete-choice models used in applied economics. Likelihoods are implemented in C++ and exposed to R for use with generic optimizers (e.g., optim(), nloptr). The package emphasizes efficient handling of high-dimensional alternative-specific constants and currently supports multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL).
