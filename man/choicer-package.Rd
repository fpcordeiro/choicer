\title{choicer: Discrete Choice Models for Economic Applications}
\description{
Tools for estimating discrete-choice models used in applied economics. Likelihoods are implemented in C++ and exposed to R for use with generic optimizers (e.g., optim(), nloptr). The package emphasizes efficient handling of high-dimensional alternative-specific constants and currently supports multinomial logit (MNL), mixed logit (MXL), and nested logit (NL).
