\arguments{
\item{theta}{vector collecting model parameters (beta, L, delta (ASCs))}

\item{X}{design matrix for covariates with fixed coefficients; sum(M_i) x K_x}

\item{W}{design matrix for covariates with random coefficients; sum(M_i) x K_w or J x K_w}

\item{alt_idx}{sum(M) x 1 vector with indices of alternatives within each choice set; 1-based indexing}

\item{choice_idx}{N x 1 vector with indices of chosen alternatives; 1-based indexing relative to X; 0 is used if include_outside_option=True}

\item{M}{N x 1 vector with number of alternatives for each individual}

\item{weights}{N x 1 vector with weights for each observation}

\item{eta_draws}{Array with choice situation draws; K_w x S x N}

\item{rc_correlation}{whether random coefficients should be correlated}

\item{use_asc}{whether to use alternative-specific constants}

\item{include_outside_option}{whether to include outside option normalized to 0 (if so, the outside option is not included in the data)}

\item{eps}{numerical tolerance}
