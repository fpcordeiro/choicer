\arguments{
\item{opt_result}{Result object from nloptr optimization containing at least \code{solution} element.}

\item{X}{Design matrix used in estimation.}

\item{W}{Design matrix for random coefficients.}

\item{alt_idx}{Alternative indices for each observation.}

\item{choice_idx}{Chosen alternative indices for each choice situation.}

\item{M}{Vector of number of alternatives per choice situation.}

\item{weights}{Vector of weights for each choice situation.}

\item{eta_draws}{Array of shape K_w x S x N with standard normal draws for random coefficients.}

\item{rc_dist}{Integer vector indicating distribution of random coefficients (0 = normal, 1 = log-normal).}

\item{rc_correlation}{Logical indicating whether a full covariance matrix was estimated for random coefficients.}

\item{rc_mean}{Logical indicating whether means were estimated for random coefficients.}

\item{use_asc}{Logical indicating whether ASCs were included in the model.}

\item{include_outside_option}{Logical indicating whether an outside option was included in the model.}

\item{omit_asc_output}{Logical indicating whether to omit ASC parameters from the output table.}

\item{param_names}{Optional vector of parameter names. If \code{NULL}, default names are generated.}

\item{file_name}{Optional file path to save the coefficient summary table as a CSV file. If \code{NULL}, no file is saved.}
}
\value{
A data frame (invisibly) with columns: Index, Parameter, Estimate,
Std_Error, z_value, Pr_z, and Signif. For variance parameters, the delta method
is applied to transform from Cholesky to covariance scale. The table is also
printed to the console.
}
\description{
Prints and saves coefficient summary table for mixed logit model.
