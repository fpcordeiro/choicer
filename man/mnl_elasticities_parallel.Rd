\arguments{
\item{theta}{K + J - 1 or K + J vector with model parameters}

\item{alt_idx}{sum(M) x 1 vector with indices of alternatives; 1-based indexing}

\item{choice_idx}{N x 1 vector (kept for API consistency, but not used)}

\item{M}{N x 1 vector with number of alternatives for each individual}

\item{weights}{N x 1 vector with weights for each observation}

\item{elast_var_idx}{1-based index of the column in X for which to compute the elasticity}

\item{use_asc}{whether to use alternative-specific constants}

Computes the aggregate elasticity matrix (weighted average of individual
elasticities) for the Multinomial Logit model.
