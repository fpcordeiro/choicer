Description: Tools for estimating discrete-choice models used in applied economics.
    Likelihoods are implemented in C++ and exposed to R for use with generic optimizers (e.g., optim(), nloptr).
    The package emphasizes efficient handling of high-dimensional alternative-specific constants and currently supports multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL).
